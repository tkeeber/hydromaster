	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_1">Start the day with a cup of hot water with a good
		squeeze of fresh lemon. This will give your digestive system a real
		boost.</string>
	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_2">Instead of caffeine and alcohol, drink water.
		Caffeine and alcohol act as diuretics and cause the body to lose
		water.</string>
	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_3">Throughout the day have water constantly available;
		keep a water bottle on your desk so you can top up your glass
		throughout the day and carry a bottle of water with you when you are
		on the go.</string>
	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_4">Create a daily schedule; drink a glass after
		breakfast, one before lunch etc. You may want to track your water
		intake, use iHydation to ensure that you drink enough water!</string>
	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_5">If you are cold, drink warm water instead of coffee
		or tea which can dehydrate you.</string>
	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_6">Ask for a glass of water to go with your coffee and
		tea in Cafes.</string>
	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_7">Drink a glass of water before and during each meal.
	</string>
	<string name="tip_increase_water_intake_8">Don’t forget to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables
		as these have a high water content and will contribute to your daily
		water intake.</string>
	<string name="tip_why_its_important">Water makes up about two-thirds of our body weight.
		And its important for this to be maintained because most of the
		chemical reactions that happen in our cells need water. We also need
		water for our blood to be able to carry nutrients around the body.
	</string>
	<string name="tip_how_much_water_do_i_need">A simple question with no easy answers. Studies
		have produced varying recommendations over the years, but in truth,
		your water needs depend on many factors, including your health, how
		active you are and where you live. Hydromaster uses these factors to
		determine a recommanded amount of water for you to be drinking each
		day.</string>
	<string name="tip_lose_weight_1">Water is the number one most important thing to
		address when it comes to losing weight, because water actually
		increases your bodies ability to metabolize fat. Here is how:</string>
	<string name="tip_lose_weight_2">Your liver is the organ that deals with
		metabolizing fat, and your kidneys deal with straining the toxins out
		of the water you drink. However, if you do not have enough water in
		your system already, your kidneys will not be able to do their job. In
		this case, your body shifts some of the work over to your liver.
	</string>
	<string name="tip_lose_weight_3">The idea that drinking too much water or a certain
		temperature of water will make you bloat is a myth. Your body bloats
		when it is dehydrated because it believes that you are not going to
		give it enough water, so it will save what is already there. The ONLY
		way to deal with bloating is to drink more water. Bloating is a sure
		sign that you are dehydrated.</string>
	<string name="tip_lose_weight_4">It may be inconvenient at first because you will
		have to pee more often, but the reason that you are running to the
		bathroom is actually great; your body is finally letting go of all the
		old, toxic water that its been holding onto. The water that you are
		drinking is usually not the first water that you excrete after being
		dehydrated. Now your body knows that you will be replacing the water,
		so it is not panicking and storing it, it is letting go to make room
		for the fresh, clean water you are sending in. After a few days or a
		week, the bathroom trips will slow down and your body will get into a
		great rhythm, which includes reduced appetite, more luminous
		complexion, and better muscle tone, as well as a more efficient
		metabolism. </string>
	<string name="tip_warning_1">Increasing your water intake may cause you to have
		to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. To avoid
		this, you may want to stop drinking water a few hours before
		bedtime--or make sure you visit the toilet before bed!</string>
	<string name="tip_warning_2">It is possible to "overdose" on water. Water
		intoxication occurs when the electrolytes in the body are so diluted
		that they have trouble keeping the balance of water even inside and
		outside of individual cells. What that means is that drinking too much
		water (while not getting enough electrolytes) can cause your cells to
		burst. If you plan on doing heavy prolonged exercise, be sure to
		alternate sports drinks with regular water to keep your electrolytes
		in balance. Three glasses of water to one glass of typical sugary
		sports drink is ideal if you rely on sports drinks for electrolytes
		during very heavy prolonged exercise, such as a marathon.</string>
	<string name="tip_warning_3">People with some heart conditions, high blood
		pressure or swelling of the lower legs (edema) need to avoid excess
		water. If you have a history of kidney problems, especially if you
		have had a transplant, consult your doctor before increasing your
		fluid intakes.</string>
	<string name="tip_warning_4">You shouldn\'t drink too much water while eating as
		it dilutes your stomach acid and can cause digestion problems.
	</string>
	<string name="tip_warning_5">In some countries, tap water is dangerous and can
		cause diseases such as jaundice. Make sure you know whats safe and
		what isn\'t.</string>

	<string name="water_fact_1">1) Roughly 70 percent of an adult\'s body is made up
		of water.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_2">2) At birth, water accounts for approximately 80
		percent of an infant\'s body weight.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_3">3) A healthy person can drink about three gallons
		(48 cups) of water per day.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_4">4) Drinking too much water too quickly can lead to
		water intoxication. Water intoxication occurs when water dilutes the
		sodium level in the bloodstream and causes an imbalance of water in
		the brain.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_5">5) Water intoxication is most likely to occur
		during periods of intense athletic performance.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_6">6) Soft drinks, coffee, and tea, while made up
		almost entirely of water, also contain caffeine. Caffeine can act as a
		mild diuretic, preventing water from traveling to necessary locations
		in the body.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_7">7) Pure water (solely hydrogen and oxygen atoms)
		has a neutral pH of 7, which is neither acidic nor basic.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_8">8) Water dissolves more substances than any other
		liquid. Wherever it travels, water carries chemicals, minerals, and
		nutrients with it.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_9">9) Much more fresh water is stored under the ground
		in aquifers than on the earth\'s surface.</string>
	<string name="water_fact_10">10) The earth is a closed system, similar to a
		terrarium, meaning that it rarely loses or gains extra matter. The
		same water that existed on the earth millions of years ago is still
		present today.</string>
